# C Books and Projects

Welcome to my repository, **C Books and Projects**, where I document my journey learning C programming. This repo contains a series of subdirectories, each dedicated to different books and/or projects I am working on.
These were projects and directories from over the years in multiple computers that I've decided to organize and refactored. 

The project is also my attempt at understanding assembly a little better. I am achieving this by examining the assembly code generated by the compiler for the codes I have written before. I am using compiler explorer to assist me in this process.

## Structure

Each subdirectory is named after the book or project it represents. Within each subdirectory, you'll find the source codes, notes, and additional resources I've compiled or created.

## Objectives

This repository aims to:
- Track my progress as I learn C programming.
- Serve as a reference for specific concepts and coding techniques in C.
- Share my learning experiences with others who might find it useful.

## Books and Projects

Here's a list of books and projects currently included in this repository:
- [Book/Project Name 1]
- [Book/Project Name 2]
- [Book/Project Name 3]
- *More to be added as I progress.*

## How to Use This Repository

Feel free to explore the subdirectories. Each one contains a README that provides more details about the book or project, including key concepts covered and personal insights.
